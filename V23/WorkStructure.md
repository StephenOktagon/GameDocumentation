# Work Structure
The work structure will stay pretty much the same from Version 22.

One important change to note is that **ALL EMPLOYEES MUST** use code names from this version onwards. Oktagon will give these out as necessary.

# Main Chain
- Leader: Jayda
- Co-Leader: Ruby
- Master: Stephen
- Co-Master: Yuuki
- Proxies: Hod, Mitch, Siesta, Gabriella
- Spare Proxies: Helena, Cathy

# Notes
Branch 36 & Branch 23 are merging. This is not up for debate. Branch 23 has caused too many issues that it cannot be ignored any longer. We hope this merge will help everyone work much better this time around.
