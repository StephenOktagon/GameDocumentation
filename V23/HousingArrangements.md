# Housing Arrangements
The children are between the ages of 5 and 7. Therefore, they are unfit to live on their own.

We have a mansion in Birmingham where the 4 children + 4 proxies will live. The mansion has been fitted with cameras in every room. The Leader will keep watch on the camera at all times.
