# Housing Arrangements
The children are between the ages of 5 and 7. Therefore, they are unfit to live on their own.

We have rented an apartment in Birmingham where the 4 children + the Master will live. The apartment has been fitted with cameras in every room. The Leader (confirmed female) will keep watch on the camera at all times.

When the children reach teenage years, we will send proxies to live with them in separate housing unless they wish otherwise.
